# Dimension 3: Representation - Arity

## Description

Represented as a tuple N:M, it describes whether several entities are involved in data computation. The first element specifies if the attribute is computed for a single entity (e.g. a test case) or a group of entities (e.g. a test suite). The second element indicates whether the value depends on a single entity (e.g. the test case itself) or not (e.g. other test cases o several pieces of code).

By clicking on each value, you will access to the list of attributes belonging to each type:

* [1:1](1-1.md)
* [1:N](1-N.md)
* [N:N](N-N.md)
