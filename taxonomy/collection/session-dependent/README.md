# Dimension 2: Collection - Session-dependent

## Description

This category specifies whether the attribute value changes when a new testing session is carried out (dynamic) or not (static). A third option, named “evolving” is defined
to indicate that changes in the SUT might affect testing outcomes.

By clicking on each value, you will access to the list of attributes belonging to each type:

* [Dynamic](dynamic.md)
* [Evolving](evolving.md)
* [Static](static.md)
