## Description

Number of method calls in each test case. Each method can be weighted with respect to its fault-proneness or the type of invocation.

## Source

* Group: relational information (less frequently, testing and sut groups too)
* Entity: invocation

## Collection

* Artefact: source code, traces
* Observation: derived
* Session-dependent: static 

## Representation

* Type: numerical
* Arity: 1:N
